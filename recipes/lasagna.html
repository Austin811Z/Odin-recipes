    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>Making lasagna is like building a tasty, layered casserole. 
        You essentially make two main things: 
    </p>

    <p>a meaty tomato sauce and a creamy cheese mixture, 
        then stack them up with pasta sheets and bake it 
        until it's bubbly and golden.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Spices and seasoning</li>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a 
                skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the 
                onion and continue cooking until it's 
                translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, 
                half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons 
                of salt, oregano, and sugar.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in 
                lightly salted water until they're al dente.
            </li>

            <li>
                Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, 
                Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, 
                the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.

            </li>

            <li>
                Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients 
                according to the recipe (starting with sauce 
                and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna 
                is assembled.

            </li>

            <li>
                Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in 
                the preheated oven for about half an hour. 
                Remove the foil and continue baking until the 
                top is golden brown.

            </li>
        </ol>

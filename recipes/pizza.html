                    <li>quarter cup pizza sauce</li>
                    <li>half cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Place a pizza stone on an outdoor 
                        grill directly over a wood fire. 
                        You may first need to spread out the 
                        wood if the flames are too high.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roll out pizza dough on a flat surface 
                        to desired thickness. Place on the 
                        pizza stone; cook until golden on one 
                        side, about 10 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer dough to a flat work surface; 
                        spread pizza sauce in an even layer 
                        onto cooked side of dough, leaving 
                        ½-inch edge bare. Sprinkle mozzarella 
                        cheese on top sauce; top with pepperoni.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place pizza on the pizza stone; tent 
                        with aluminum foil and cook until 
                        cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. 
                        Transfer pizza to a cutting board. 
                        Cool slightly before cutting and 
                        serving.
                    </li>
